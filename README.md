# Virtual-ATM-machine

## Description
Virtual-ATM-machine is a program that emulates the operation of a virtual ATM.

The emulator works in console mode and allows you to perform basic operations with an ATM, such as:
- creating and logging into your virtual account;
- tracking the balance on the virtual account.

The project uses a SQL database.

## How to use it
To use the program, run the Bankomat.exe file. After that, the console application will open and you will be prompted to select the initial action (create or log into a virtual account). Further work is going on in a similar mode.
